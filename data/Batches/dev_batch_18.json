Sodium iodate (500 mg per day orally) will restore serum T3 levels to normal in 48-72 hours.This is a radiographic contrast medium that not only inhibits the release of thyroid hormones but also reduces the conversion of T4 to T3 and is, therefore, more effective than potassium iodide or Lugol's solution.",
