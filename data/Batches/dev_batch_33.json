        "exp": "Remember 3 \u2018FUNDAS: Highest maternal mortality is associated with Class III of clarkes cl;assification, so any of those diseases are given they will have the worst prognosis. Amongst them also Eisenmengers syndrome has the worst prognosis.\n\u2193\n2. Stenotic heart disease have a worse prognosis than regurgitant lesions.\nAmong stenotic disease-(in alphabetical order)-Aortic stenosiswill have the worst> Mitral stenosis>Pulmonary stenosis.\n\u2193\n3. Congenital heart disease and Mitral valve prolapse have the best prognosis\nSo now this question becomes very easy-Mitarl vave prolapse has the best prognosis, so it is ruled out; Regurgitant lesions have a better prognosis than stenotic lesions so mitral regurgitation is also ruled out. Now we are left with 2 options, aortic stenosis and pulmonary stenosis-as I said go alphabetically, aortic stenosis will have a worse prognosis than pulmonary.\nLet\u2019s consider each of the options one by one and see what Williams has to say about each of them.\nOption \u201ca\u201d Mitral regurgitation\n\u201cM R is well-tolerated during pregnancy probably due to decreased systemic vascular resistance which actually results in less regurgitation. Heart failure only rarely develops during pregnany.\u201d\nWilliams Obs. 22/e, p 1026, 23/e, p 966\nOption \u201cb\u201d Mitral valve prolapse\n\u201cPregnant women with mitral valve prolapse rarely have cardiac complications. In fact pregnancy induced hypervolemia may improve alignment of mitral valve.\u201d\nWilliams Obs. 22/e, p 1030, 23/e, p 971\nOption \u201cc\u201d Aortic stenosis\n\u201cAlthough mild to moderate degree of aortic stenosis is well tolerated but severe degree is life threatening.\u201d\nWilliams Obs. 22/e, p 1026, 23/e, p 967\nOption \u201cd\u201d Pulmonary stenosis\n\u201cIt is well tolerated during pregnancy and rarely causes any complication.\u201d\nWilliams Obs. 22/e, p 1027, 23/e, p 968",
