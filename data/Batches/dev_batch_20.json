However, there is little or no correlation for orthodontic wires between the coefficients of friction and surface roughness. (i.e., interlocking and plowing are not significant components of the total frictional resistance).\u00a0\nAlthough NiTi has greater surface roughness, beta-Ti has greater frictional resistance, it turns out that as the titanium content of an alloy increases, its surface reactivity increases, and the surface chemistry is a major influence on frictional behavior. Thus, beta-Ti, at 80% titanium, has a higher coefficient of friction than NiTi at 50% titanium, and there is greater frictional resistance to sliding with either than with steel.\nKey Concept\nAlthough NiTi has greater surface roughness, beta-Ti has greater frictional resistance.\nRef: Proffit 4th edition page 378",

Tth polymerase (Thermus thermophilus HB-8) has Polymerase as well as reverse transcriptase activity when mixed with manganese ions and can thus be used for the amplification of RNA to cDNA.

The \ufb01rst non-nucleated red cell is a reticulocyte, which still contains ribosomal material in the cytoplasm, giving these large cells a faint blue tinge (\u2018polychromasia\u2019). Reticulocytes lose their ribosomal material and mature over 3 days, during which time they are released into the circulation. Increased numbers of circulating reticulocytes (reticulocytosis) reflect increased erythropoiesis.\nProliferation and differentiation of red cell precursors is stimulated by erythropoietin, a polypeptide hormone produced by renal interstitial peritubular cells in response to hypoxia. Failure of erythropoietin production in patients with renal failure causes anaemia, which can be treated with exogenous recombinant erythropoietin or similar pharmacological agents called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, e.g. darbepoetin.\nReference: : Davidson P R I N C I P L E S\u00a0 \u00a0and Practice O F M E D I C I N E 23rd edition page no\u00a0 915",

B: Obstruction of lymphatic ductsInflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a very aggressive type of breast cancer in which the cancer cells block the lymph vessels in the skin of the breast.This type of breast cancer is called \"inflammatory\" because the breast often looks swollen and red, or \"inflamed\", sometimes overnight, and can be misdiagnosed as mastitis.Invasion of the local lymphatic ducts impairs drainage and causes edematous swelling of the breast. Because the skin of the breast is tethered by the suspensory ligament of Cooper, the accumulation of fluid may cause the skin of the breast to assume a dimpled appearance similar to an orange peel (peau d'orange).IBC is sometimes misdiagnosed as an insect bite or breast infection.
