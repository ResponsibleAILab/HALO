Increased pressure in blood vessels containing baroreceptor causes increased impulse firing. Baroreceptor signal enters the nucleus tractus solitarius, inhibit the vasoconstrictor center of the medulla, excite the vagal center. The net effects are inhibition of sympathetic activity, which causes vasodilation of veins & aerioles, decreased hea rate & strength of hea contraction.

Upper Extremity* Olecranon is most common site of upper limb stress fractures. Pelvis and SpinePars inter aicularis of 5th lumbar veebral (causing spondylolysis) is commonest in spine. Clinical Presentation* Load related pain often bilateral* The hallmark physical finding is tenderness with palpation and stress.

In cord prolapse the patient is allowed to rest in exaggerated elevated Sims position with a pillow under the hip.\nManagement of Non-reassuring fetal status (Fetal Distress)\n\nLateral positioning avoids compression of vena cava and aorta by the gravid uterus. This increases cardiac output and uteroplacental perfusion.\nOxygen is administered to the mother with mask to improve fetal SaO2.\nCorrection of dehydration by IV fluids (crystalloids) improves intravascular volume and uterine perfusion.\nCorrection of maternal hypotension (following epidural analgesia) with immediate infusion of 1 litre of Crystalloid (Ringer\u2019s solution).\nStoppage of oxytocin to improve fetal oxygenation. Fetal hypoxia may be due to strong and sustained uterine contractions.
