Now here let\u2019s take a look at its management.\\\nManagement of DIC\n\nThe most important step is to terminate the pregnancy- vaginal delivery without episiotomy is preferred to cesarean section\nVolume replacement by crystalloids or colloids will reduce the amount of whole blood needed to restore the blood volume.\n500 ml of fresh blood raises the fibrinogen level approximately by 12.5 mg/100 ml and platelets by 10,000\u201315,000 cu mm. Fresh blood- helps in flushing out fibrin degradation product and improving the micro circulation.\nTo replace fibrinogen- Fresh frozen plasma should be given: Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is extracted from whole blood. It contains fibrinogen, anti-thrombin III, clotting factors V, XI, XII. FFP transfusion provides both volume replacement and coagulation factors. One unit of FFP (250 mL) raises the fibrinogen by 5-10 mg/dL. FFP does not need to be ABO or Rh compatible.\nCryoprecipitate is obtained from thawed FFP. It is rich in fibrinogen, factor VIII, Von Willebrand\u2019s factor, and XIII. Cryoprecipitate provides less volume (40 mL) compared to FFP (250 mL). So it should not be used for volume replacement. One unit of cryoprecipitate increases the fibrinogen level by 5-10 mg/dL.\nIn case of active bleeding with platelet counts < 50,000/ml or prophylactically with platelet count 20\u201330,000/ml \u2013 platelet replacement should be done. Platelet should ABO and Rh specific. 1 units (50 ml) raises the platelet count by 7500/ ml\nRecombinant activated factors VIIA: (60-100 \u03bcg/kg IV) can reverse DIC within 10 minute as it is a precusor for extrinsic clotting cascade which is replaced.\nRole of Heparin\n\nAccording to Williams Obs. \u201cHeparin is not used in DIC.\u201d\nAccording to COGDT 10/e, p 999\n\u201cHeparin acts as an anticoagulant by activating antithrombin III but has little effect on activated coagulation factors. Anticoagulation is contraindicated in patients with fulminant DIC and central nervous system insults, fulminant liver failure, or obstetric accidents. The one instance, however, in which heparin has been demonstrated to benefit pregnancy-related DIC is in the case of the retained dead fetus with intact vascular system, where heparin may be administered to interrupt the coagulation process and thrombocytopenia for several days until delivery may be implemented.\u201d\nAs far as EACA is concerned- Williams Obs. 22/e, p 844 says \u2013\n\u201cEACA is not recommended in case of DIC.\u201d\nAccording to Williams Obs 23/e, p 787\n\u201cIt use in most types of obstetric coagulopathy has not been efficacious & not recommended\u201d",

Mother starts producing and transferring antibodies approximately 5 days after the onset of her disease.Thus, babies born 5 days or more from the beginning of maternal disease will be protected.\n\nFernando Arias 3/e, p 156\n\nPerinatal varicella exposure just before or during delivery poses a serious threat to newborns and so Varicella Ig should be given to all neonates of born to mothers who have clinical evidence of varicella 5 days before and upto 2 days after delivery.\nThe use of VZIG decreases the chances of neonatal varicella and also modify the clinical course but it does not always prevent severe or fatal varicella. Expectant treatment with close observation, followed by prompt initiation of antiviral therapy on suspicion of neonatal varicella is recommended.\nAntiviral treatment (acyclovir) is given to neonates only if they develop neonatal varicella syndrome.\nVaccine is not secreted in breast milk, so postpartum vaccination should not be delayed because of breast feeding.",
