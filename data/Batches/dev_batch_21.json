Do not overlook fracture of tooth and alveolar ridge.\nReimplant the tooth gently with firm finger pressure. Ask the patient to bite down firmly on a piece of gauze to help stabilize the tooth.\nAfter evaluating the occlusion, stabilize the tooth if required. Ideal splint required for an avulsed tooth is a flexible splint. The commonly used flexible splints are made of Gortex, metallic mesh stripes, synthetic clothes or orthodontic wire. A thick strip of composite bonded to the avulsed and the adjacent teeth also act as a splint.\n\nThe splint should engage several teeth around the avulsed tooth and it should be kept in place for not more than 7 to 10 days.\n\nContinue with the same treatment as above.\n\nTooth with open apex:\n\nClean the root surface with saline.\nExamine the alveolar socket after cleaning it with saline.\nCover the root surface with minocycline hydrochloride microspheres before reimplanting to kill bacteria which could enter the immature apex and form an abscess.\nContinue with the same treatment as above.\n\nRef: Textbook of endodontics, Nisha Garg and Amit Garg, 3rd edition, pg no:477",
