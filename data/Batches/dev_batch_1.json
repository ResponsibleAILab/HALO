In majority, it remains asymptomatic. Jaundice is rare and fever is uncommon.\nClinical course (HBV): Nearly 90\u201395% of patients clear the infection and have full recovery. 1% develop fulminant hepatitis resulting massive hepatic necrosis. 10-15% become chronic and 10% of these chronic cases suffer from chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.\nDiagnosis is confirmed by serological detection of HBsAg, HBeAg (denote high infectivity) and antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) and HBV DNA titer (107\u20131011).\nScreening: All pregnant women should be screened for HBV infection at first antenatal visit and it should be repeated during the third trimester for \u2018high risk\u2019 groups (intravenous drug abusers, sexual promiscuity, hemophilics, patients on hemodialysis or having multiple sex partners).\nHepatitis C (HCV):\nIt is recognized as the major cause of non-A, non-B hepatitis worldwide and is the leading cause of transfusion associated hepatitis. Transmission is mainly blood borne and to a lesser extent by faecal-oral route. It is responsible for chronic active hepatitis and hepatic failure.\nPerinatal transmission (10\u201340%) is high when coinfected with HIV and HBV.\nDetection is by antibody to HCV by EIA, which develops usually late in the infection.\nConfirmation is done by recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA-3).\nChronic carrier state is present. Breastfeeding is not contraindicated.\nHepatitis D (HDV):\nIt is seen in patients infected with HBV either as a co-infection or super infection. Perinatal transmission is known.\nHepatitis E (HEV): Hepatitis E is the most important cause of non-A, non-B hepatitis in developing countries like India. Chronic carrier state is present. Perinatal transmission is uncommon.\nMaternal mortality is very high (15\u201320%).",

AdherenceBiofilm in the bacteria leads antimicrobial resistance by acting as mechanical barrier, increased excretion of antibiotics and altered metabolism inside the biofilms.Growth in biofilms leads to altered microbial metabolism, production of extra cellular virulence factors, and decreased susceptibility to biocides, antimicrobial agents, and host defense molecules and cells. P aeruginosa growing on the bronchial mucosa during chronic infection, staphylococci and other pathogens growing on implanted medical devices, and dental pathogens growing on tooth surfaces to form plaque are several examples of microbial biofilm growth associated with human disease.",
