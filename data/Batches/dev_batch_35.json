Chemical fixatives can be considered as members of three major categories: coagulant, cross-linking, and compound. Coagulant fixatives: Both organic and non-organic solutions may coagulate proteins making them insoluble. Cellular architecture in vivo is maintained primarily by lipoproteins and fibrous proteins such as collagen. Coagulating these proteins maintains tissue histomorphology at the light microscope level. Unfounately, because coagulant fixatives result in cytoplasmic flocculation and poor preservation of mitochondria and secretory granules, these fixatives are not useful in ultrastructural analysis. Examples: Ethanol, methanol, acetone, picric acid and trichloroacetic acid Cross-linking fixatives: Several chemicals were selected as fixatives secondary to their potential actions of forming cross-links both within and between proteins and nucleic acids. Examples include formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde and other aldehydes, e.g. chloral hydrate and glyoxal, as well as metal salts, e.g. mercuric and zinc chloride, and other metallic compounds, e.g. osmium tetroxide. useful for electron microscopic examination - Glutraldehyde (best one)/formaldehyde/osmium tetraoxide Compound fixatives: Alcoholic formalin",

        "exp": "Ans. DThe epidermis is composed of 4 or 5 layers, depending on the region of skin being considered.Those layers in descending order are:Cornified layer (stratum corneum)Composed of 10 to 30 layers of polyhedral, anucleated corneocytes (final step of keratinocyte differentiation), with the palms and soles having the most layers.Clear/translucent layer (stratum lucidum, only in palms and soles)This narrow layer is found only on the palms and soles. The epidermis of these two areas is known as \"thick skin\" because with this extra layer, the skin has 5 epidermal layers instead of 4Granular layer (stratum granulosum)Keratinocytes lose their nuclei and their cytoplasm appears granular. Lipids, contained into those keratinocytes within lamellar bodies, are released into the extracellular space through exocytosis to form a lipid barrier. Those polar lipids are then conveed into non-polar lipids and arranged parallel to the cell surface.Spinous layer (stratum spinosum)Keratinocytes become connected through desmosomes and sta produce lamellar bodies, from within the Golgi, enriched in polar lipids, glycosphingolipids, free sterols, phospholipids and catabolic enzymes.Langerhans cells, immunologically active cells, are located in the middle of this layer.Basal/germinal layer (stratum basale/germinativum).Composed mainly of proliferating and non-proliferating keratinocytes, attached to the basement membrane by hemidesmosomes.Melanocytes are present, connected to numerous keratinocytes in this and other strata through dendrites.Merkel cells are also found in the stratum basale with large numbers in touch-sensitive sites such as the fingeips and lips.",

The aim is to increase parents' confidence in understanding their baby.\nAn infant's reaction are state related. So it is extremely important that observations of state be considered as a starting point from which all other observations are made.\nThe ideal time to administer the examination is when the infant is asleep and midway between feeding cycles.\n\nScores \nSleep states\n\nState 1 : Sleep with regular breathing, eyes closed, no spontaneous activity except startles or jerky movements at quite regular intervals.\n\na State 2 : Sleep with eyes closed; rapid eye movements can often be observed under closed lids; low activity level with random movements and startles.\nAwake states\n\nState 3 : Drowsy or semidrowsy; eyes may be open but dull and heavy lidded, or closed, eyelids fluttering; activity level minimal, Movements are usually smooth, although there may be startles. Some infants may also show fuss/cry vocalizations in this state. What distinguishes state 3 from state 5 when both are accompanied by fuss/cry vocalizations is the minimal movement in state 3 and considerable movement in state 5.\nState 4 : Alert, eyes open with bright look. Motor activity is minimal; there can be a glazed look that is easily changed into a brighter look with appropriate stimulation.\n\n\nState 5 : Eyes likely to be open; considerable motor activity, with thrusting movements of the extremities, and even a few spontaneous startles; reactive to external stimulation with increase in startles or motor activity.\n\n\nState 6 : Crying : characterized by intense, loud, rhythmic, and sustained cry vocalizations that are difficult to break through with stimulation; motor activity is high.\n\nComing to the question\n\nAccording to above staging, the newborn in our question comes under state 6 (crying lustily, and moving all 4 limbs).\nIf you have any confusion, read the following facts on crying (state 6) :-\n\n\"it is important to distinguish between crying as a state (stage 6) from the fuss/ay vocalization that can occur in state 5 and even state 3. Some infants show repeated episodes of fuss /cry vocalization in state 5 but may not reach state 6. This may also be a maturational issue, because some preterm infants may not have energy reserves to sustain state 6. In general, state 6 Can be distinguished from state 5 by the intensity and sustained quality of the crying (at least 15 seconds) and unavailability of infant in state 6. Repeated brief episodes of cry /fuss in state 5 do not mean that the infant has moved into state 6. Examiners need to give the infant the opportunity to show state 6\"\n\nSo, crying lustily with all limbs moving (child in question), straight away goes in state 6.",
