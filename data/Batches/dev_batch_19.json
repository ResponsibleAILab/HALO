Nitrates act by production of nitric oxide (NO). NO stimulates guanylate cyclase in smooth muscles which leads to formation of cGMP. Later acts on smooth muscles to cause vasodilation. Nitrates mainly produce NO in veins leading to its predominant action as venodilation. Dilation of veins results in decrease in pre-load. Therefore major mechanism of action of nitrates in angina is decrease in preload.

Irradiation - causes - reduction in the number of the immunocompetent cells (lymphocytes mainly) Irradiation of cellular blood components (red blood cells, platelets, and granulocytes) is indicated to prevent the development of transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD). Patients at risk of TA-GVHD include immunocompromised patients who are receiving a bone marrow or stem cell transplant and fetuses undergoing an intrauterine transfusion. Irradiation is also indicated for recipients of components collected from a blood relative or HLA-matched donors. 3. Leukocyte reduction - Leukoreduction of whole blood and blood components has been shown to reduce recurrent febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions, reduce alloimmunization to leukocyte antigens that may complicate care of patients whoundergo transplantation or chronic transfusion therapy, and protect against transmission of cytomegalovirus (CMV) to patients at increased risk of CMV disease. antibodies in the recipient - react with donor leukocytes - release of cytokines - cause fever- known as Febrile Non-Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction. 4.
