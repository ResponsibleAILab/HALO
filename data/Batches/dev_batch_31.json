Methyl mercury is a major safety concern because it bioaccumulates through the food chain; its pharmacokinetic half-life is longer (1.5 to 3 months) than that of ethyl mercury (less than 1 week). In air, the concentrations of mercury range from about 0.01 to 0.02 \u00b5g/m3.\nMercury accumulates in the kidneys. In the brain, metallic mercury can be converted to an inorganic form that is retained in the brain. Elemental mercury and mercury vapor have a half-life of 1 to 3 months. Mercury leaves the body by excretion through urine and feces.\nExposure to high levels of mercury can injure the brain, kidneys, and developing fetus. Chronic mercury toxicity may be manifested as tremors; memory loss; and changes in personality, vision, and hearing.\nReference: PHILLIPS\u2019 SCIENCE OF DENTAL MATERIALS, 12th ed page no 124",

Cephalometrically, Ricketts\u2019 E line is drawn from the tip of the nose to the soft tissue chin. Normal values suggest that the upper lip is 4 mm behind the E line, while the lower lip lies 2 mm behind this reference line. It is important to mention that, this reference line is influenced a great deal by the growth of the nose and also varies with age and sex. Ricketts recommended that lip position should be analyzed using the nose\u2013chin line as a reference point.
